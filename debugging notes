#Creatinga Count down for the end of the year.  
Print = "Schools out for summer" 
Had to understand if I needed to import just time or datetime. 
This helped : https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html 

PM vs. Am for time?  24 hour time. 

Ran first and got : type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'datetime'
  Adjusted to datetime.datetime(2019,4, 28, 11, 00)
  Got error í TypeError: descriptor 'date' requires a 'datetime.datetime' object but received a 'int'
  Tried adding int(before each number) 
 Mess up first with end-start.... realized quickly that mistake 

Tried adding brackets around the date….still error. Then removed the "0" Still getting not attribute for datetime
Realized that I didnt need datetime.datetime --that was my error. Removed that and left the int() for the times and it worked. 
I had the message as schools out for summer and it was printing that along with the actual count down.

Changed the messaginga and then added an if statement to have it print a message once the semester was over saying 'School's out for summer"

Wanted to add if the start date was greater than the end date... it would print Schools out for summer!
Used an ' for school's out …. Got the error because of the messed up string.
Removed that and ran it...successfully
